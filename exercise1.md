# Exercise 11.1

For this exercise I am choosing Java ecosystem. For Java linting popular tools are for example Checkstyle or SonarLint.
Checkstyle is a tool to enforce coding standards and to keep a more consistent formatting and style for the code. 
SonarLint is another tool with similar purpose as for linting for code analysis and code quality. 
SonarLint can give real-time feedback on coding issues, contextual assistance to fix issues and helps developer to make better coding decisions.

For testing JUnit is a popular tool for Java. Developers can ue it to write and run tests with help of annotations and assertions.

For building Gradle or Apache Maven are popular tools for Java. Both offer build automation and managing project dependencies

Alternatives to Jenkins or GitHub Actions could be e.g., GitLab which can be used as version control but also for CI/CD as it is an part of the platform.

As this is a pretty standard setup containing steps to lint, test, build and deploy a cloud-based environment could be more beneficial as it is easier to setup and at the same time and it is not necessary to setup a complete own system as it runs in the cloud.
One thing to consider wold be only the constraints of the cloud-based options as these are often limited by the available resources of the provider and it could be not possible to increase the resources if necessary for a project.
